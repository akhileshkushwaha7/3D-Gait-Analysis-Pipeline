# 3D Gait Analysis Pipeline

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A reproducible pipeline for 3D gait analysis using AlphaPose for 2D pose estimation and MotionBERT for 3D motion reconstruction from videos. Handles video rotation, pose estimation, keypoint plotting with filtering, and 3D conversion. Designed for gait lab videos (e.g., ankle tracking) at 1080x1920 resolution.

## Features
- Video preprocessing (90Â° counterclockwise rotation).
- 2D pose estimation with AlphaPose.
- JSON output processing to Excel.
- Plotting filtered ankle keypoints (Butterworth low-pass).
- 3D keypoint conversion from MotionBERT .npy to Excel.
- Modular scripts for automation.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3D-Gait-Analysis-Pipeline.git
cd 3D-Gait-Analysis-Pipeline
2. Initialize submodules for AlphaPose and MotionBERT:
3. Create virtual environment
4. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
5. Follow setup in alphapose/README.md and motionbert/README.md.

## Scripts
1. Rotate video (Make sure it is in 1080X1920 resolution
2. Run AlphaPose ( Env Setup : set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\Users\akhileshsing2024\AlphaPose
Run Alphapose : python scripts\demo_inference.py --cfg configs\coco\resnet\256x192_res50_lr1e-3_1x.yaml --checkpoint pretrained_models\fast_res50_256x192.pth --video "C:\Users\akhileshsing2024\Downloads\GaitAnalysisProject\openpose\openpose\examples\media\120FPS_short_rotated.mov" --outdir output\ --save_video --pose_track) 
3. Process AlphaPose JSON to Excel
4. Plot keypoints for Alphapose(just to verfiy)
5. Run Motionbert ( python infer_wild.py --vid_path "C:\Users\akhileshsing2024\Downloads\GaitAnalysisProject\openpose\openpose\examples\media\120fps_rotated.mov" --json_path "C:\Users\akhileshsing2024\AlphaPose\output\alphapose-results.json" --out_path "C:\Users\akhileshsing2024\AlphaPose\results" )
6. Process MotionBERT 3D .npy to Excel

   
## Pipeline Overview
1. Rotate portrait video.
2. Estimate 2D poses with AlphaPose.
3. Convert JSON to Excel and plot filtered ankles.
4. (Optional) Run MotionBERT inference (see motionbert/README.md).
5. Convert 3D .npy to Excel.
